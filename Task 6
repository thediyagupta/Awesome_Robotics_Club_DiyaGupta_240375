PART A

I would use an hybrid mechanism(tracked and legged).because climbing requires both stability and adabtibility to varying step heights or angles.

 

I choose a **hybrid mechanism** that combines tracked and legged systems.

Climbing stairs can be tricky because it involves both **vertical movement** and **stability on uneven terrain**. I felt that relying on a single mechanism like wheels or legs alone might not be sufficient for all kinds of stairs—especially irregular or damaged ones. That’s why I opted for a **hybrid approach**, combining the strengths of both **tracks** and **legs**.

### advantages of Tracked?

- Tracks are great for providing continuous contact and traction.
- They distribute the robot’s weight evenly and are efficient at climbing **regular, shallow stairs**.
- They also perform well on inclined and rough surfaces.

However, I realized that tracks alone would struggle with:

- **Tall vertical rises**
- **Broken or irregular steps**

### Why Legs?

- Legs offer **adaptability**. They can step over obstacles or adjust to different stair heights.
- They give the robot more freedom to **balance** and reposition itself when needed.

But legs have their downsides too—they're complex to control and not as energy-efficient.

### Why Both?

By combining both systems:

- The **tracks handle efficient climbing** on standard stairs.
- The **legs kick in** when the robot encounters irregular or more challenging obstacles.
- This allows the robot to perform in **a wider range of real-world environments**—from household stairs to rubble in disaster zones

### Stability

Stability is achieved by using tracked mechanism
Because the track is in **constant contact** with the ground over a large surface area, it provides better grip and distributes weight more evenly than wheels.
Because more of the robot is in contact with the ground, tracked robots can **climb slopes and stairs** with greater stability and less risk of tipping.

COM: centre of mass would be kept as low as possible to ensure stability.

### Sensors Used:

1. IMU:
    - Helps monitor the robot’s orientation, tilt, and balance.
    - Crucial for maintaining stability on inclined or uneven steps.
2. Vision Sensor **:**
    - Captures a 3D view of the environment.
    - Allows the robot to measure stair height, depth, and irregularities before climbing.
    - Enables step detection and helps decide when to switch between track and leg modes.
3. Ultrasonic Sensors ****(Front & Downward Facing):
    - Measures distance to nearby steps or walls.
    - Useful for short-range obstacle detection and edge detection to prevent falling.

### Control Logic

- First the vision camera along with the Ultrasonic sensor  will detect the step (height, depth) and accordingly the mode is switched between tracked and wheeled.
- If stairs are regular and low → use tracks for energy-efficient climbing. and if they re steep or irregular → use legs.
- IMU checks for stability while climbing.
- PID or similar logic can be used to calculate optimal path for next few steps.

PART B

In case  Midway through the climb, **one side of the crawler (left or right) stops** due to a **motor fault or gear jam**.
This willl cause the robot to lose its straight path and possibly move **diagonally or sideways**, which is dangerous on stairs.
the legs on the stuck side might try to compensate, increasing the strain and possibly causing further imbalance.imu will detect the unusual tripping of bot. ALso the vision sensors and ultrasonic sensors will detect the sudden unexpected changes in input.

### How would I prevent such fall?

Firstly with the help of IMU and vision sensors, the side which has stopped working will be detected.

Then power or torque to the opposite side wheels will be reduced to balance out the sideways motion.

The legs of the opposite side will extend or reposition in such a way to rebalance the bot.
